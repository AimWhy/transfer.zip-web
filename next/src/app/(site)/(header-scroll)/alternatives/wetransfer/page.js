WeTransfer's free tier feels tighter every year: the cap is now **2 GB per transfer**, links expire after **7 days**, and since December 2024 you're limited to **10 transfers per month** . If you routinely send RAW photos, 4K footage, or full project folders, those ceilings hurt - so it pays to know the competition.

## What we compared

For each service we checked the features that matter most when you just need the file to land on the other side:

| Key Metric | Why it matters |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Free-tier size limit** | Determines whether you can skip chopping or compressing your project. |
| **Retention window** | How long recipients have before the link dies. |
| **Security options** | Passwords or full-link encryption for sensitive work. |
| **Daily/Monthly caps** | Some tools throttle how many gigs or transfers you can push. |
| **Ads & UI** | A slick, ad-free landing page looks more professional. |

## 1. Transfer.zip - Instant, limitless P2P streams

If you need to get a 150 GB project archive to an editor right now, Transfer.zip's **Quick-Share** option is unbeatable. The file pipes straight from your machine to the recipient's; nothing touches a server, so there's literally **no size ceiling** and uploads start instantly. Close your browser tab and the link self-destructs. Paid subscribers can also upload files to the cloud (still no size cap) and keep them alive from 24 hours up to a year, with per-link analytics and custom domains.

*Best for*: on-deadline hand-offs where every minute counts.

---

## 2. Smash

Smash keeps its promise of **no upper size limit** - we tested with a 74 GB ProRes file and it uploaded fine. Free users can set passwords and customise the download page, but files larger than 2 GB wait in an "economy" queue at busy times. Links live for **7 days**, adjustable up to 365 days on paid plans.

*Pros*: sleek UI, Outlook plug-in, public API.
*Cons*: uploads can stall during peak hours for huge files unless you pay.

---

## 3. 4Shared

An old name in cloud storage, 4Shared now lets free users share files up to **5 GB** and - uniquely - keeps them for **up to 180 days**, so slow-to-respond clients won't miss out. The catch is mandatory registration and a clutter of banner ads.

*Pros*: generous retention, WebDAV/FTP access.
*Cons*: ads, and you must log in every 180 days or they wipe your account.

---

## 4. TransferNow

TransferNow balances ease and security: **5 GB** per transfer, passwords, region-select storage and download tracking. The free plan's only real limiter is the 7-day expiry and a max of ten recipients per transfer.

---

## 5. Send Anywhere

Focused on **one-to-one, time-critical** deliveries: enter the six-digit key on the receiving device and the file streams immediately. Share-link transfers top out at **10 GB** and vanish after **48 hours**.

*Pros*: direct P2P, iOS/Android/Desktop parity.
*Cons*: short retention, ads on the free tier.

---

## 6. pCloud Transfer

A handy side-service from the Swiss cloud-storage firm. You can move up to **5 GB** without an account and optionally encrypt everything with a password before it leaves your browser. Links last **7 days** and both sender and receiver see a clean, ad-free page.

---

## 7. FileMail

FileMail trades size for speed: the free plan gives you **5 GB** per transfer for **7 days**, but the recipient gets unlimited parallel downloads and resumable support. Great for video dailies when the whole crew needs access.

---

## 8. TransferXL

Free users get **5 GB** per send, **10 GB daily**, plus thumbnails for images/videos. It's the only service here with end-to-end encryption baked in by default, but expect display ads on the download page.

---

## 9. SwissTransfer

Run by Swiss host Infomaniak, SwissTransfer lets you hurl up to **50 GB** at once and keep it live for **30 days** - no signup, no ads, and optional passwords. The privacy angle is strong: all data stays on servers in Switzerland, under strict federal data-protection laws.

---

## Which one should you choose?

* **Need instant, limitless transfers?** Transfer.zip Quick-Share.
* **Need big but scheduled drops?** Smash or SwissTransfer.
* **Need long retention?** 4Shared (or paid plans elsewhere).
* **Need strict privacy regulation?** SwissTransfer (Switzerland) or pCloud (EU servers).

### Final tips

1. Always zip large folder trees - many services create a single archive anyway.
2. For anything sensitive, set a password and share it via a different channel.
3. Check your recipient's time-zone: a 7-day link sent Friday evening might expire before their Monday begins!

Happy transferring!
