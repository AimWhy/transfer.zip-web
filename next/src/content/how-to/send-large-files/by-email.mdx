### Option 2: Use a File Transfer Service

- Start a transfer at [Transfer.zip](https://transfer.zip) or [WeTransfer](https://wetransfer.com).
- Enter your recipient's email, upload the file, and send.
- They'll receive a secure download link.

### Option 3: Compress or Split the File

- Zip the file; if it's still too large, split it into parts with free tools like 7-Zip or Keka.
- Attach each part to a separate email if needed.

### Quick Tips

- Warn your recipient to check spam for download links.
- For sensitive files, set file passwords and share passwords via SMS or a messaging app, not in the same email.
