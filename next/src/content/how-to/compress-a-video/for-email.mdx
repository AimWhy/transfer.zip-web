### Step 1: Shorten or Trim

- Use your device's built-in editor (Photos app, Windows Photos).
- Remove non-essential parts of the video.

---

### Step 2: Lower the Quality

- Visit [Vert.sh](https://vert.sh/), [Clideo](https://clideo.com/compress-video), or [VEED.IO](https://www.veed.io/tools/compress-video), and upload your video.
- Set resolution to 480p or 720p.

---

### Step 3: Zip the File

- On Windows/Mac: Right-click the video > "Compress" or "Send to Zip".
- Attach the .zip to your email, if it fits the size limit.

### Step 4: Use a Transfer Service

If your video is still too large, send a download link using:
- [Transfer.zip](https://transfer.zip)
- [WeTransfer](https://wetransfer.com)
- [SwissTransfer](https://swisstransfer.com)
