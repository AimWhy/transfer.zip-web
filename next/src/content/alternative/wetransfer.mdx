## Why look beyond WeTransfer?

WeTransfer's free tier feels tighter every year: the cap is now **3 GB per transfer**, links expire after **3 days**, and since December 2024 you're limited to **10 transfers per month** . If you routinely send RAW photos, 4K footage, or full project folders, those ceilings hurt, so it pays to know the competition.

## What we compared

| Key metric | Why it matters |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Free-tier size limit** | Tells you whether you can skip chopping or compressing your project. |
| **Retention window** | How long recipients have before the link dies. |
| **Security options** | Passwords or true end-to-end encryption for sensitive work. |
| **Daily / monthly caps** | Some tools throttle how many gigs or transfers you can push. |
| **Ads & UI** | A slick, ad-free landing page looks more professional. |

## 1. Transfer.zip - Instant, limitless P2P plus a 7-day trial

Need to blast a **150 GB** project archive to an editor right now? Transfer.zip's **Quick Transfer** pipes the file straight from your machine to the recipient - nothing ever touches a server, so there's **no size ceiling** and uploads start instantly. Close either browser tab and the link self-destructs.

Want cloud storage, analytics or branded pages? The paid **Starter** and **Pro** tiers add uploads up to **1 TB** and retain files for up to **365 days**, and both start with a **7-day free trial** (no charge if you cancel in time).

*Best for*: on-deadline hand-offs where every minute counts.

---

## 2. Smash

Smash promises "unlimited" file sizes, but on the free tier anything over **2 GB** waits in an "economy" queue during busy hours. Under that threshold you get slick, password-protected transfers that live for **7 days**, Outlook and Chrome add-ons, plus basic page branding.

*Pros*: clean UI, no ads, public API.
*Cons*: uploads can stall during peak hours for huge files unless you pay.

---

## 3. 4Shared

An old name in cloud storage. Free users can share files up to **2 GB** and keep them as long as they **log in at least once every 180 days** (or one download happens). Expect a clutter of banner ads, but WebDAV/FTP access is handy.

*Pros*: long retention, remote-mount protocols.
*Cons*: mandatory registration, ad-heavy pages.

---

## 4. TransferNow

TransferNow balances ease and security: **5 GB** per transfer, optional passwords, EU-hosted servers and detailed download tracking. Free links last **7 days**; paid plans stretch to 365 days and 250 - 500 GB per drop.

---

## 5. Send Anywhere

Designed for **one-to-one, time-critical** deliveries. Enter the six-digit key on the receiving device and the file streams instantly. Share-link transfers top out at **10 GB** and vanish after **48 h**.

*Pros*: direct P2P, iOS/Android/Desktop parity.
*Cons*: short retention, ads on some platforms.

---

## 6. pCloud Transfer

A side service from the Swiss cloud-storage firm: up to **5 GB** per job but **200 MB per individual file**. You can encrypt everything client-side before it leaves your browser, and both sender and receiver see a clean, ad-free page. Links last **7 days**.

---

## 7. FileMail

FileMail trades size for speed: free users get **5 GB** per transfer for **7 days** and resumable, multi-threaded downloads - but you're limited to **two transfers per 24 hours** and **10 downloads per link**.

---

## 8. TransferXL

Free accounts allow **5 GB** per send, capped at **10 GB total traffic per day**. End-to-end encryption is on by default, but download pages carry banner ads. Handy thumbnails for image/video transfers.

---

## 9. SwissTransfer

Run by Swiss host Infomaniak, SwissTransfer lets you hurl up to **50 GB** at once and keep it live for **30 days** - no signup, no ads, optional passwords. All data stays on servers in Switzerland under strict federal privacy laws.

---

## Which one should you choose?

* **Need instant, limitless transfers?** Transfer.zip Quick Transfer.
* **Need big but scheduled drops?** Smash or SwissTransfer.
* **Need ultra-long retention?** 4Shared (or paid tiers elsewhere).
* **Need the strictest privacy laws?** SwissTransfer (Switzerland) or pCloud Transfer (EU).

### Final tips

1. Zip complex folder trees - many services create a single archive anyway.
2. For anything sensitive, set a password (or enable encryption) and share it via a different channel.
3. *Check your recipient's time-zone*: a 3-day WeTransfer link sent late Friday might expire before their Monday begins!
4. If you're testing paid tiers, take advantage of **free trials** - Transfer.zip (7 days), FileMail (7 days) and TransferNow (7 days) all let you kick the tyres cost-free.

Happy transferring!
